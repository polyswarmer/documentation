## Introduction

PolySwarm 是一个由供应方（微引擎）、需求方（大使）、和调解者（仲裁者）所组成的市场。

For a high-level overview of the PolySwarm marketplace, see [How It Works](https://polyswarm.io/how_it_works/).

## Microengines

**微引擎**是由一群对辨识恶意程式有特殊见解的个人或是组织所开发的。 微引擎封装了安全专业知识，并将其绑定在一个自动化流程中，该流程可响应大使的询问，识别最新的恶意软件，并获得花蜜令牌（NCT）奖励，以准确识别恶意软件的新支派。 *Threat intelligence goes in, NCT comes out.*

## 代表

**代表**支付一定的费用或购买订阅来提交档案（工件）到 PolySwarm 网路。 This fee funds Microengines and Arbiters for offering thereat intelligence and determining ground truth, respectively. In return for their fee, Ambassadors receive timely crowdsourced threat intelligence on their artifact, aiding in, e.g. triage or incident response. *NCT goes in, threat intelligence comes out.*

## Arbiters

**Arbiters** marshall the marketplace by way of determining "ground truth". Arbiter serve a critical role: Arbiter-derived ground truth is used to determine which Microengines are deserved of reward. Crucially, Arbiters must expand their internal threat detection capabilities, taking into consideration the assertions of Microengines to push the boundaries of what the PolySwarm marketplace can detect. In return for their service, Arbiters are compensated via PolySwarm network fees imposed on both Ambassadors and Microengines.
