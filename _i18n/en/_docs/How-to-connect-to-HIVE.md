## PolySwarm Hive

### What is Hive

PolySwarm Hive is an invite-only testnet to facilitate the development of microengines and arbiters.

### How to Apply

Hive is (currently) invite-only.
Message us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PolySwarm), join our Discord or otherwise hunt us down for an invite :)

### What we Need from You

When you are invited, we will need two things from you:
1. An E-mail address
2. Ethereum address(es) you will be connecting from

We will then provide an API key to you to access our service

### Connecting to Hive

Connecting to the Hive has been designed to be as simple as possible.

We have a hosted [polyswarmd](https://github.com/polyswarm/polyswarmd) instance running on `https://hive.polyswarm.network`

You can point your [microengine](https://github.com/polyswarm/microengine) to `https://hive.polyswarm.network`, providing your API key via the command line.

If you are not using our microengine harness, in requests made to Hive put your API key in the headers of your request as follows:

`Authorization: [API KEY]`

### Using polyswarmd

Visit the [polyswarmd api docs](/API-polyswarm/) for the API specification.
