# Configuring a Development Environment

PolySwarm supports both Linux and Windows based engines for all types of market participants: arbiters, ambassadors & microengines.
Irrespective of the type of engine you're creating, we strongly recommend that you base your engine on our open source (MIT-licensed) `polyswarm-client` library which will maintain feature and API parity with `polyswarmd` - your gateway to the marketplace.
The instructions presented here reflect this recommendation.

Currently, there are more Linux-based deployment options and testing Linux-based engines is far easier than testing Windows-based engines.
If your engine supports both platforms, we recommend developing in a Linux environment.
