# PolySwarm Developer Documentation

Welcome and thank you for your interest in PolySwarm!

Here you'll find everything you need to get started developing for PolySwarm.

Before we dive into the code, let's get our bearings: 
* What does it look like to participate in PolySwarm? 
* Which role fits my use case? 
* Which communities do I want to engage with?
* How do I monitor the performance of my engines?


## Roles in the Marketplace

There are several ways to participate in the PolySwarm ecosystem: will you create a microengine, an ambassador, an arbiter or something else entirely?

## Portal

The [PolySwarm Portal](https://polyswarm.network) is PolySwarm's one-stop shop for:
* tracking Engine performance
* discovering Communities (see below)
* naming Engines
* creating Profiles
* connecting with Security Experts

... and much, much more.

## Communities

PolySwarm is composed of a series of communities (hence the "Poly").
Each community serves a particular purpose and can either permit everyone to join or limit access to specific participants.

PolySwarm will launch with two communities:
* **Genesis: the public mainnet community**: everyone can join & participate!
* **Hive: a private testing community**: for initial partners preparing for launch on Genesis

This list will expand, allowing Ambassadors and Microengine developers to control their audience.
Future communities may include:
* A GDPR-complaint community with artifact sharing amongst a closed set of complaint participants.
* A network of mutually NDA'ed MSSPs & security experts.

Anyone will be able to administer their own community and advertise their community through PolySwarm Portal.

### Homechain Versus Sidechain

TODO

In production use, "homechain" may be the Ethereum mainnet or a limited-access Ethereum private network.

note for testing, there's a single home / side chain clique node
