## 서론

PolySwarm은 공급자(마이크로엔진), 수요자(홍보대사), 중개인(중재자)으로 구성된 마켓플레이스입니다.

PolySwarm 마켓플레이스에 대한 전체적인 개요는 [작동 방법](https://polyswarm.io/how_it_works/)을 참고하시기 바랍니다.

## 마이크로엔진

**마이크로엔진**은 맬웨어를 식별하는 데 소질이 있는 개인 또는 단체가 개발합니다. Microengines encapsulate security expertise and bundle it in an autonomous process that responds to queries from Ambassadors, identifying the latest malware and earning Nectar (NCT) rewards for accurately identifying new strands of malware. *Threat intelligence goes in, NCT comes out.*

## Ambassadors

**Ambassadors** pay a fee or purchase a subscription to submit files (artifacts) to the PolySwarm network. This fee funds Microengines and Arbiters for offering threat intelligence and determining ground truth, respectively. In return for their fee, Ambassadors receive timely crowdsourced threat intelligence on their artifact, aiding in, e.g. triage or incident response. *NCT goes in, threat intelligence comes out.*

## Arbiters

**Arbiters** marshall the marketplace by way of determining "ground truth". Arbiter serve a critical role: Arbiter-derived ground truth is used to determine which Microengines are deserved of reward. Crucially, Arbiters must expand their internal threat detection capabilities, taking into consideration the assertions of Microengines to push the boundaries of what the PolySwarm marketplace can detect. In return for their service, Arbiters are compensated via PolySwarm network fees imposed on both Ambassadors and Microengines.
